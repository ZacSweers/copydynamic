CopyDynamic
===========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hzsweers/copydynamic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hzsweers/copydynamic)

Prototype of generating `copyDynamic` extension functions for data classes, such that you can do this:

```kotlin
@CopyDynamic
data class Foo(val bar: String = "bar", val baz: String = "baz", val fizz: String = "fizz")
```

And have a `copyDynamic` extension function generated to allow for dynamic setting of variables in a copy call.

```kotlin
val foo = Foo()

val newFoo = foo.copyDynamic {
  bar = "newBar"
  if (someCondition) baz = "newBaz"
}
```

**Configuration**

You can optionally specify a `copydynamic.generated` annotation processing option 
with a value of either `"javax.annotation.processing.Generated"` (JDK 9+) or `"javax.annotation.Generated"` (JDK <9).

Incremental annotation processing is disabled by default (as Kapt doesn't formally support this when generating Kotlin sources currently).
This does appear to work in Android projects though with Kotlin 1.3.30+. If you want to try this, you can
enable it via `copdynamic.useFiler`.

```gradle
kapt {
  arguments {
    arg("copydynamic.generated", "javax.annotation.Generated")
    arg("copydynamic.useFiler", "true")
  }
}
```

**Caveats**
* The generated intermediate builder has `internal` visibility for its constructor, which can be considered a bit of a leaky API. If you use this, it's recommended to put 
your models in a separate module to avoid leaking this.
* Properties must be `internal` or `public` visibility.
